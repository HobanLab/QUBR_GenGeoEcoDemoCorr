## load packages
```{r}
library(sf) # spatial data package
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(nlme) # linear mixed effect models
library(geoR) # compute variogram
```
## load data
```{r}
# load spatial data - polygon shapefile of census tracts in Chicago 
tract_data_1 <- st_read("data_for_Ash/tract_data.shp") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3435) # transform to coordinate reference system with units as feet, this is Illinois State Plane CRS

tract_data_df <- read_csv("data_for_Ash/tract_data_df.csv")
# load data frame version of data to get full column names

# add full column names to spatial data frame
names(tract_data_1) <- c(names(tract_data_df))

# add xy coordinates of centroids for polygons
# will be used to model spatial autocorrelation
tract_data <- tract_data_1 %>%
  cbind(st_centroid(.) %>% # calculate centroid of each tract, can also just use x-y coordinates of observations
          st_coordinates %>% # extract coordinates
          as.data.frame()) %>% # turn coordinates into dataframe
  as.data.frame() # remove spatial structure from object
```

# 1. Construct model without spatial auto correlation in error modeled
### 1a. Construct model
```{r}
model_lme <- lme(ndvi_z_spei_slope ~ majority_population +
                             log10_income +
                             percent_veg +
                             percent_tree, 
                        data = tract_data,
                        random = ~1 | side, # random effect of neighborhood area (e.g., north side)
                        method = "ML")

summary(model_lme)
```

### 1b. Construct variogram to assess spatial autocorrelation among residuals
What is a variogram: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram
```{r}
coordinates <- tract_data[, c("X", "Y")]
values = resid(model_lme)
v1 <- variog(coords = coordinates, data = values)
plot(v1)
```

# 2. Construct model where expected errors are spatial autocorrelated (SAC = spatial autocorrelation)
UCLA tutorial on modeling SAC in error
https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-do-i-model-a-spatially-autocorrelated-outcome/

### 2a.Construct and initialize spatial autocorrelation structure
There are a few different error structures that can be used. The best option for my data was corExp (exponential error structure). For guidance on how to determine which is best for your data, use this page: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-do-i-fit-a-variogram-model-to-my-spatial-data-in-r-using-regression-commands/
```{r}
# define correlation structure
# need to chose an appropriate value (range) for the model based on variogram
cs1Exp <- corExp(value = c(range = 20000), # chose an appropriate range - distance at which residuals are not spatially autocorrelated, needs to be in units of coordinate reference system (in this case feet)
                 form = ~ Y + X) # indicate which spatial variables to be used to calculate distance (x and y)

# initialize structure
cs1Exp <- Initialize(cs1Exp, tract_data)

# view correlation matrix
corMatrix(cs1Exp)[1:10, 100:150]

```

### 2b. Define error correlation strucure in model
Depending on number of parameters and observations, may take a little while to fit
```{r}
model_lme_sac <- lme(ndvi_z_spei_slope ~ majority_population +
                             log10_income +
                             percent_veg +
                             percent_tree, 
                        data = tract_data,
                        correlation = cs1Exp,
                        random = ~1 | side, # random effect of neighborhood area (e.g., north side)
                        method = "ML")

summary(model_lme_sac)
```
# 3. Assess which model is better using AIC
AIC is lower for model with SAC error structure
```{r}
print(paste("No SAC Structure Model AIC:", AIC(model_lme)))
print(paste("SAC Structure Model AIC:", AIC(model_lme_sac)))
```
