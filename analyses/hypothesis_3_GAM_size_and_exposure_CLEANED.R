# %%%%Looking to see if Q. brandegeei size/shape relate to their exposure%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# The purpose of this script is to evaluated whether the size and shape of Quercus brandegeei 
# individuals across all sites is impacted by their slope and/or elevation and/or aspect 
# using generalized additive models (GAMs)

# We used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) after having trouble with multiple linear 
# regressions because of issues with the normality conditions and some nervousness about linearity. 

# The script is broken into sections of
# 1) Loading and processing the packages and processed data for the trees, topography, and soil metrics in the Las Matancitas,
#San Dionisio, and La Cobriza populations. The processed data includes:
      # Processing the tree spatial/size data and river outline shapefiles to be in UTM 12 N Equal Area Projection, fixing errors in elevation,
#generating river and point buffers and bounding boxes,
      # Extracting and processing slope, elevation, and aspect (4 and 8 cardinal directions) data using 15 m res rasters,
# 2) Creating Generalized Additive Models to look at the relationships between the shape/size of trees and their aspect, elevation, and slope

#### Generalized Additive Models ####

# For each population/all populations and each size/shape metric we created
     #generalized additive models whereby...

    # a) We removed NAs from the explanatory and response variables
    # b) We then created four base GAM models: 
              #one with no smoothing (basically a linear regression) with all explanatory variables (elevation, slope, and aspect)
              #one with smoothing on all quantitative explanatory variables (elevation, slope),
              #one with smoothing on the first quantitative explanatory variable (elevation),
              #one with smoothing on the second quantitative explanatory variable (slope)
    # c) We compared the four models AIC values to see which one had the lowest, supporting which model fits the data the best
    # d) We then checked if the conditions of the GAM were met well (normal distribution and equal variance 
        #of the residuals since we are using a GAM with a Gaussian distribution)
    # e) Using the dredge function to determine which explanatory variables allow for the best fitting model
    # f) Comparing the previously selected function and the dredge function to see which one is a better fit 
        #using AIC and an ANOVA F-test (only works if one models variables are entirely present in the other model)
    # g) We then ran a K check on the chosen model (if it used smoothing) to see if the K dimension choices for the model are adequate
        #p-values may indicate that the basis dimension, k, has been set too low, especially if the reported edf is close to k
    # h) We then plotted the GAMs to be able to describe the relationship between the explanatory variables and the size/shape characteristics 
    # i) We then looked for interactions and compared the interaction model to the previous best model and if we have a significant interaction term we have to consider
    # j) We then plotted the interactions both in 2D and 3D

#We used only the 8 categories to get a more specific idea of how direction may be influencing size 

# all points 

#had to remove points 174 and 175 because they had NAs in the slope data and there was a NA in elevation we needed to remove to continue the analysis
