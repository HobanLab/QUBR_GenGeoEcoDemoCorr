# %%%%Looking to see if Quercus brandegeei Population Locations Are Influenced by Their Soil Metrics%%%%%%%%%%%%
# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# The purpose of this script is to determine if the soil of the Quercus brandegeei locations are 
# significantly different than would be expected if the populations were randomly distributed around Baja California Sur.
# A significant difference could indicate which soil metrics may explain why the trees are found only in these
# distinct riverbed pockets. 

# To test this, we used soil metric spatial null model analysis whereby we compared the mean soil metric of the 
# 20 known populations to a distribution of the mean soil metric values for randomly permuted populations across BCS,
# to support the populations have significantly different soil metrics compared to other parts of BCS without assuming
# a normal distribution. 

# The script is broken into sections of
# 1) Loading and processing the packages and processed data for the trees, topography, and soil metrics in the Las Matancitas,
#San Dionisio, and La Cobriza populations. The processed data used in this script includes:
        # Processing the tree spatial/size data and river outline shapefiles to be in UTM 12 N Equal Area Projection, fixing errors in elevation,
#generating river and point buffers and bounding boxes,
        # Processing the soil raster data: loading the data in projecting the data, cropping them to the bounding 
#boxs around the  rivers, stacking the rasters for each population, and processing them into one dataframe for all and each population
        # Creating the four new soil metrics: Sandy available Water (0-5 and 100-200 cm) and Clay/Loam Available Water (0-5 and 100-200 cm)
        # Loading and processing a dataframe of the 20 known QUBR population locations and creating cropped soil metric rasters for the 7km radius around the populations in BCS,
#and extracting the known population soil metric values
# 2) Making a function for calculating the real and randomized mean soil metrics, comparing the real
# and randomized mean metrics for each soil metric, and calculating the p-values. 
# 3) Running the function and storing the output, graphing the histograms/slopes, turning the results into a dataframe
# 4) Using a heat map to summarize the results (the mean soil metrics and their significances)

## Finalizing the tree soil metric dataframe

#combining the LM, LC, and SD tree dataframes with the soil metrics and randomly chosen points within each grid cell

#### Creating the Function Comparing Average Soil Values from Inside Populations to Outside Populations ####

# This function iterates over each soil metric and compares the average soil metric across the known populations
# to a distribution of randomly generated distribution populations means to see if the known populations have significantly
# different soil metrics compared at random. 

# The components of the function are
  # 1) generating an empty list for the soil means and the p-values from comparing the real and randomized population soil means.
  # 2) a loop to iterate over each soil metric in which 
        # generate a list of random soil means from randomly distributed populations (n=20, 1000 permutations),
        # plots of the cropped Baja California Sur polygon and the randomly selected points,
        # store the soil mean for the known population,
        # plot and stored the figure showing the real soil mean and a histogram of the randomly generated soil means,
        # generate the p-values (using significantly different),
        # and store the real population soil eans and p-values in their respective lists

#creating the list of soil metrics to iterate over
